# Innkeeper System
Program that makes it easy to record data and print reports regarding the finances an apartment building.

## Request For Proposal
John Nguyen is a small-time landlord: He owns an apartment building with 20 units. He wants us to write a program that will make it easier for him to record data and print reports regarding the finances of the apartment building. If we can agree with John on payment, schedule, and the overall purpose of the program, we've completed the inception part of the development process.  
  
Currently John is recording all the information about his apartment building by hand, in old-fashioned ledger books. He shows us the forms he's currently using. There are four of them:  
1. The Tenant List
2. The Rental Income Record
3. The Expense Record
4. The Annual Summary
  
The Tenant List shows apartment numbers in one column and the corresponding tenant's names in the adjacent columns.  
  
The Rental Income Record records incoming rent payments. It contains 12 columns, one for each month; and one row for each apartment number. Each time John receives a rental payment from a tenant, he records it in the appropriate row and columns of the Rental Income Record.  
  
The Expense Record records outgoing payments. It has columns for date, the payee (the company or person to whom John writes the check), and the amount being paid. In addition , there's a column where John can specify the budget category to which the payment should be charged. Budget categories include Mortgage, Repairs, Utilities, Taxes, Insurance, and so on.  
  
The Annual Report uses data from the Rental Income Record and Expense Record to summarize how much money came in and how much went out during the year. All the rents are summed and the result is displayed. The expenses are summed and displayed by the budget category, which makes it easy to see, for example, how much was spent on repairs during the year. Finally, expenses are subtracted from income to show how much money John made (or lost) during the year.  
  
John tells us that he wants the program to pretty much duplicate what he's currently doing on the paper forms. He wants to be able to enter data about tenants, rents, and expenses, and display the various reports.  

## Problem Statement
John finds it tedious to calculate the rental income and expenses by hand for over 20 housing units. This problem affects John because John unnecessarily spends too much time on making records by hand when he could use that time for other tasks. A successful solution to Johnâ€™s problem and tedious work would be a way to easily track specific records, save John time from paper-bookkeeping, better overall organization, a method for faster calculations, and to make data easily transferable (mobile).  

## Vision Statement
A product has been made for John. A way for easier, faster, and more organized bookkeeping with less room for error. This product is called The Innkeeper, a bookkeeping software program. The benefits of The Innkeeper is that there is no longer a need for paper records, the software does all the hard work and number crunching for him and that it is very simple and straightforward, ultimately saving John a lot of time. Unlike our competitor, Excel, our product offers a more optimized way to complete bookkeeping tasks. As opposed to more broad data entry software programs, we offer an easier and more specified approach.
